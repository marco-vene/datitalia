# DatItalia
This project aims at sharing Italian socio-economic data with the public.

Currently, the National Institute of Statistics, [Istat](www.istat.it) does not provide a user friendly interface where citizens can easily explore the data collected, hence I developed the [DatItalia](https://marcovene.shinyapps.io/DatItalia/) Shiny App.

The App allows to:
* interactively select metrics
* read metric descriptions
* display interactive trend line plots with plotly
* break down the trend lines in the most relevant dimensions (age, territory, gender...)
* filtering specific trimester to easily compare YoY changes and remove seasonality
